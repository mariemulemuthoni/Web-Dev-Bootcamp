**Introduction**

This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through the Web Development Bootcamp, which I am currently undertaking on Udemy. In this comprehensive course, I am learning a wide range of web development skills, and I am excited to share what I am learning with you.

I am learning the foundations of Web Development which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this course, I am also to learn about the world of DOM (DOcument Object Models), AJAX, working with APIs,  and JSON.

I am also excited learn more about NodeJS, the universe of NPM (Node Package Manager) and interacting with JavaScript frameworks such as Express. 

At the same time, I will also learn how to : define RESTful Routes, use NoSQL databases like MongoDB, connect Mongoose to MongoDB & Express. An introduction to React and JavaScript XML (JSX) will also be done in the course. 

Throughout the learning experience, there will be different coding exercises as well as a project to showcase what I have gathered in my time of learning. All the instructions & code for the different exercises and the project will be shareded in this repository. 

Thank you for joining me on this web development journey, and I hope you find the resources in this repository helpful whether you are a beginner or an expert as you explore the exciting world of web development!
